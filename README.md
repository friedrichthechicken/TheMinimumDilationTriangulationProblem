# TheMinimumDilationTriangulationProblem
Work started on may 2019 on the minimum dilation triangulation problem. Using a new approach, we computed, among other things, the dilation of regular polygons up to 35 and beyond. We also made significant theoretical improvements on the problem of dilation of sets of points in convex position. Two talks were given on the subject, one at University of Liège on September 24, 2019 and another one on October 29, 2019. A paper is being written on the subject and will be posted soon on arxiv.org. Cédric Pilatte and Damien Galant.
